    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In circular particle accelerators, the particles are confined to circular orbits with strong focusing quadrupole magnets. The quadrupole magnets exert a linear restoring force on the particles. A quadrupole magnet will focus a beam of particles in the horizontal plane and defocus the beam in the vertical plane, or vice versa. To compensate for this, accelerator rings have a series of alternating focusing and defocusing quadruple magnets that have a net focusing effect on the beam[1]. For this reason, these kinds of accelerators are also referred to as alternating gradient machines. Alternating gradient machines are used because the mean deviation of the synchronous orbit from the ideal orbit is much smaller in an alternating gradient machine than in a constant gradient machine[2].\n",

    "This image shows the magnetic fields of alternating gradient quadrupoles. In order to change the gradient of the magnet, the north and south poles are switched. The red ovals are representative of particle beams being vertically and horizontallty focused by the magnets. The particles get repeatedly focused and unfocused in the vertical and horizontal axes.\n",

    "\n",
    "The equations of motion of the particles in an accelerator can be described with a linear approximation. This can be done using the following curvilinear coordinates[2]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$s = $ the distance along the equilibrium orbit measured from some fixed reference point to that point on the orbit closest to the point $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$x = $ the horizontal component of the displacement of $P$ from the equilibrium orbit (taken to be positive in the outward direction)\n",
    "\n",
    "$z = $ the vertical component of the displacement\n",
    "\n",
    "The equations of motion for a particle in orbit are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2x}{ds^2} = -\\frac{1-n(s)}{\\rho^2(s)}x$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d^2z}{ds^2} = -\\frac{n(s)}{\\rho^2(s)}z$$\n",

    "$$n=-\\frac{r}{B}\\frac{\\partial B}{\\partial r}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\rho(s)$ is the radius of curvature of the equilibrium orbit at $s$, defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho(s) = \\frac{pc}{eB_z (s,0,0)}$$\n",

    "$$n(s) = - \\frac{\\rho^2}{pc/e} \\frac{\\partial B_z}{\\partial x}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These equations of motion are periodic and satisfy Hill's equation. The equations of motion are generally non-linear, but in order to do a linear approximation one can keep only the lowest order terms of $x$ and $y$. Then, the equations of motion can be written in the form:\n",

    "### Stability of Particle Oscillations\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to maintain a particle beam in a circular accelerator, the particle oscillations must remain stable. Mathematically, this condition is that the value of $$M^n\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "y \\\\\n",
    "y'\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "must remain finite as $n$ becomes arbitrarily large. Physically, $n$ represents the number of times a beam of particles passes through a unit cell.[7]\n",
    "\n",
    "The regions of stability and instability can be found mathematically in terms of the magnetic index for consecutive unit cells. To do this, start by considering the eigenvalues of the matrix $M$, which can be written as $$\\lambda_{\\pm} = e^{\\pm i \\mu}$$\n",

    "For simplicity, $M$ can be set to $$M = \\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\n",
    "a & b \\\\\n",
    "c & d\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then solving the eigenvalue equation yields:\n",

    "\n",
    "$$1 - (a+d)\\lambda + \\lambda^2 = 0$$ $$\\lambda^{-1} + \\lambda = a+d$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$cos(\\psi) = \\frac{1}{2}TrM$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$M = Icos(\\mu) + Jsin(\\mu)$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The $kth$ power of the matrix $M$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$M^k = Icos(k\\mu) + Jsin(k\\mu)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expression has properties similar to the complex exponential $e^{ik\\mu} = cos(k\\mu) + isin(k\\mu)$. If follows from this and the expression for $M^k$ that if $\\mu$ is complex, $M^k$ will increase indefinitely with increasing $k$, and if $\\mu$ is real $M^k$ will oscillate and not increase indefinitely with increasing $k$. Therefore, the particle motion is stable if $\\mu$ is real, and unstable if $\\mu$ is complex.[2]\n",

    "\n",
    "In this figure $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the values of the magnetic index in consecutive unit cells. The stability is at a maximum for $n_1 = n_2$. In this figure $\\mu_z$ and $\\mu_r$ correspond to the vertical and radial phase advances, respectively. There is vertical instability outside the curves corresponding to $cos(\\mu_z) = 1$ and $cos(\\mu_z) = -1$ and there is radial instability outside the curves corresponding to $cos(\\mu_r) = 1$ and $cos(\\mu_r) = -1$. In the center of the stability region, $cos(\\mu_z) = cos(\\mu_r) = 0$ and $\\mu_z = \\mu_r = 0$. This corresponds to four magnetic periods per betatron wavelength. Within the region of stability, the ocillations take the form of sinusoidal curves with small periodic wriggles. In most cases, these wriggles are small compated to the sinusoidal oscillations.[5]\n",

    "\n",
    "The figure below is a plot of the horizontal and vertical oscillations for particles in the LHC. The lines are histogram bars corresponding to a beam postition measured at a given point in the ring.[1]\n",

    "\n",
    "The tune of an accelerator is a very important parameter, since it characterizes the particle oscillations, and a shift in tune is indicative of an error in the magnetic field gradient.\n",

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In circular particle accelerators, beams of particles are steered by magnetic fields. This is acomplished with the use of quadrupole magnets. Depending on it's magnetic field gradient, a quadrupole magnet will focus a particle beam in one plane, and defocus the beam in another perpendicular plane. In order to create a net focusing effect, accelerators are set up with a series fo quadrupole magnets that alternate in the sign of their magnetic field gradient. The equations of motion for particles going through these magnets can be calculated and expressed with transfer matricies. The motion of these particles is sinusoidal. In order for the motion of the particles to be stable, the phase advance through one repeat period must be real. These are a few of the physical and mathematical properties of strong focusing quadrupole mangets used in particle accelerators.\n",
