    "In circular particle accelerators, the particles are confined to circular orbits with strong focusing quadrupole magnets. The quadrupole magnets exert a linear restoring force on the particles. A quadrupole magnet will focus a beam of particles in the horizontal plane and defocus the beam in the vertical plane, or vice versa. To compensate for this, accelerator rings have a series of alternating focusing and defocusing quadruple magnets that have a net focusing effect on the beam[1]. For this reason, these kinds of accelerators are also referred to as alternating gradient machines. Alternating gradient machines are used because the mean deviation of the synchronous orbit from the ideal orbit is much smaller in an alternating gradient machine than in a constant gradient machine[2].\n",

The blue dots represent particles passing through the magnetic field. As the animation shows, the particles get repeatedly focused and unfocused in the vertical and horizontal axes.\n",
