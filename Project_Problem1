Electromagnetism of Particle Accelerators

Particle accelerators are very interesting to me, so I would like to do my
project on the electromagnetic principles used to make particle accelerators
work. In accelerators, charged particles are accelerated using electric fields
and steered using magnetic fields.

In a circular accelerator, such as a cyclotron or synchrotron, there are
electric fields along the path of the particles. These fields can change from
negative to positive or vice versa in such a way that the particles are always
pulled towards a field of opposite charge. Dipole and quadrupole magnets are
used to steer and focus the beam of charged particles. Quadrupole magnets focus
the beam of particles to keep them together, while dipole magnets steer the
particles in a circle around the accelerator.
