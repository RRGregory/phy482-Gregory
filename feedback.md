## Assignment 1

Ruth, particle acceleration is an important and, yet, a very broad topic in physics. I think you have the right idea with starting with papers that are more general and/or historical on the topic. For Friday, I think reading the Holzer article and summarizing it will be important, but you might also want to find an additional review article that helps make sense of physics behind the accelerators. The reason being is that the Holzer article seems like a very general overview of what is happening, but doens't necessarily dig into the details - some of which will be needed to write this paper well. It's a good start you have here, but I want to make sure that you are pushing into some of the details a bit more.

* Score: 20/20
