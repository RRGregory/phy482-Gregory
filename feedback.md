## Assignment 2

Ruth, I'm glad that you read the Holzer article and followed it up with the Courant one. They both seem to have helped alot in focusing your paper on the magnetic fields that focus the particles in the accelerator. That is certainly a narrowly enough scoped topic for a paper if that's where you are thinking about spending your research effort. So, I'd encourage you, if that's what you want to aim for, to read more about the underlying physics of these quadupole magnets and how they relate to the focusing of the beams. In the next week, I'll be looking for a more detailed dive into that topic and also where you begin to bring out the mathematical models that describe how all this works. It's important to summarize what you are learning, but it is also important for this paper to describe how the underlying physics gets modeled. Great work!

## Assignment 1

Ruth, particle acceleration is an important and, yet, a very broad topic in physics. I think you have the right idea with starting with papers that are more general and/or historical on the topic. For Friday, I think reading the Holzer article and summarizing it will be important, but you might also want to find an additional review article that helps make sense of physics behind the accelerators. The reason being is that the Holzer article seems like a very general overview of what is happening, but doesn't necessarily dig into the details - some of which will be needed to write this paper well. It's a good start you have here, but I want to make sure that you are pushing into some of the details a bit more.
